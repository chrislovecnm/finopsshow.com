“The FinOps Show” breaks down cost-savings incites from world-class industry leaders.  
FinOps is an emerging practice that helps companies focus on computer infrastructure cost savings.   
For years we have had a gap between company earnings, profits, and computer engineering costs, 
and our guests provide information that helps you bridge that black hole.  
We bridge the hole through culture and process changes backed by data and financial management.

The PodCast is short form, either 15 or 30 minutes, and is accessible in video and audio formats.
